//Q9. Design a Java program for managing student enrollment in a university, adhering to the 
//principles of loose coupling and high cohesion. Your program should include classes for 
//representing students (`Student`), courses (`Course`), and enrollment management 
//(`Enrollment`). Ensure that the `Enrollment` class interacts with the other classes indirectly 
//through an interface class (`EnrollmentSystem`). Implement methods for enrolling and 
//dropping students from courses, and displaying enrollment details. Create a `Main` class to 
//demonstrate the system's functionality, with appropriate error handling and user-friendly output 
//messages. Provide comments in your code explaining how loose coupling and high cohesion 
//are maintained throughout the implementation
