/*
 * -Here we use lock.wait() and lock.notifyAll() to ensure that sent is executed first then receive in alternate manner.
 * -We also use a written flag to implement it.
 * -Using while(written); on its own does not work, as there is not a guarantee that both method work alternatively.
 * also the above method does not work at all and is inconsistent as hell, I don't know why but it is
 * -Using lock.wait() ensures that CPU is not busy-waiting, which is more efficient.
 * -lock's method only works in a synchronized block, hence it is wrapped in one. 
 * 
 * -on a small note, the written flag should be set to false first to ensure that sent is run before receive.
 * -also lock can be implemented using any random object as wait() and notifyAll() function is present in Object class
 * try it yourself, I don't want to right now...
